Create a Python library named HashLib to provide a wrapper for hashing functions. This library includes implementations for SHA256 and Blake2b hashing algorithms. The library ensures that hashing is performed on byte arrays in memory and provides functionality to benchmark the hashing speed. Additionally, the library allows setting parameters at the top of each file and includes a benchmarking feature to report the hashing speed. The library should include unit tests.
