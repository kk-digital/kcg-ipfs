Create a Python library named UuidLib for generating 64-bit unsigned UUIDs. Each UUID consists of the first 32 bits representing Unix time as an integer, and the last 32 bits chosen at random. The library includes a statically typed class to hold the UUID, along with functions to convert the UUID to and from various formats, including integer string, hexadecimal string, and back. Make unit tests for the library.
