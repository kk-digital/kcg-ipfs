Create a Python library named ComputerSurveyLib to survey computer information. This library includes a strongly typed class named ComputerSurvey to gather information such as computer hostname, number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, and LAN IP address for the Ethernet interface. Additionally, the class provides methods for pretty-printed JSON serialization and deserialization, and unit tests to validate it's functionality.
