Create a python library for HTTP Request Wrapper. There must be a Request class that has fields: uint64 UUID, string RequestPath, string RequestParameters, timedate RequestTimeSent, string RequestServerAddress, string RequestRoute, and []byte RequestBody. There must be a Response class that has fields: uint64 UUID, string ResponseErrorString, int ResponseHttpCode, []byte ResponseBody, timedate RequestTimeStart, timedate RequestTimeFinished, float RequestCompletedTime. Each field must be strongly typed. Each class must have a json serialization and json deserialization functions. There must be a HTTPRequestWrapper class that will serialize a given Request to json. HTTPRequestWrapper must have a function to deserialize given json data to Response class. Add a unit test for Request class using random generated data and make sure to have an assert. Add a unit test for Response class using random generated data and make sure to have an assert. Add a unit test for HTTPRequestWrapper class using random generated data and make sure to have an assert.
