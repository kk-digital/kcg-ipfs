Create a Python library named TcpNetLib to manage TCP connections and servers. This library includes functionality for managing outgoing TCP connections and TCP servers. For outgoing connections, it provides a list of connections along with information about the IP address, port, and data sent/received. For TCP servers, it allows listening on ports and provides a list of all active connections. The library should include unit tests.
